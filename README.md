## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Dataset**: CBIS-DDSM mammogram dataset.  
2. **Models**: Deep learning models such as **Xception, DenseNet, MobileNet** were trained and evaluated.  
3. **Preprocessing**: Image normalization, resizing, and augmentation.  
4. **Training**: Fine-tuning pretrained models on mammogram images.  
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were measured.  
6. **Deployment**: Best model integrated with Flutter mobile application.
